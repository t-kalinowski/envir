Description: Provides a small set of functions for managing R environments, with defaults designed to encourage usage patterns that scale well to larger code bases. It provides: import_from(), a flexible way to assign bindings that defaults to the current environment; include(), a vectorized alternative to base::source() that also default to the current environment; and attach_eval() and attach_source(), a way to evaluate expressions in attached environments. Together, these (and other) functions pair to provide a robust alternative to base::library() and base::source().
